  Maintain `docs/design/context-map.md` — the one-page table of every place this presentation layer touches
  something outside it — recording two things per edge: who owns the boundary, and whether a translation layer
  sits in between. They are recorded together and decided apart, and that split is the skill: whether a wire
  type is translated before it leaves `adapters` is settled by the dependency matrix, while who owns the
  boundary is an organisational fact no code reading supplies. Ownership is therefore proposed as evidenced
  candidates for a human to choose. Use it when a new outbound call, inbound entry point, or third-party mount
  appears — 「外部との接点を整理して」「この口は地図に載ってる？」. Do NOT use it to check the map against reality (`context-map-audit`)
  or to describe how an edge works.

# Context Map

Enumerate what this layer touches outside itself, and record two things per edge — **one the machine
decides, one only a person can.**

A Japanese reference translation lives at `SKILL.ja.md` in this directory (for human reference only;
not loaded as a skill).

## When to Use

- A new outbound call, inbound entry point, or third-party mount appeared.
- The map should be brought up to date after a batch of work.
- `context-map-audit` reported an edge that exists in code but not on the map.

## Contract

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Owns** | 接触点の列挙、辺ごとの「境界の所有」と「翻案の有無」の記録、所有の候補提示 |
| **Never** | 所有のラベルを自分の権限で書く / 各辺の仕組みをここへ書く / 主題ごとの design 文書を書き換える |
| **Starts when** | 外部との接点が増減した、あるいは地図を最新化するとき |
| **Stops when** | 所有が人に確認され、地図が書かれたとき |

## Do NOT use this skill for

- **Checking the map against reality** — `context-map-audit`. This one writes; that one only reads.
- **Describing how an edge works.** That belongs to the subject reference under `docs/design/` that
  owns it. The map points there.
- **Adding a configuration value** — `new-env`.

## The one thing this skill must not do

**It must not decide who owns a boundary.**

The map records two axes per edge, and they are recorded together because a reader needs both — but
**they are decided in completely different ways**, and conflating them is how a map acquires labels
nobody can defend:

- **翻案の有無 is decided by the machine.** Types generated from a contract live in the `adapters-gen`
  area of [`architecture.ts`](../../../architecture.ts), and only `adapters` may reach it — so a
  generated type is necessarily translated before it leaves. **Read the dependency matrix; there is
  no judgment here.**
- **境界の所有 does not come out of the code at all.** Whether this project can negotiate with that
  counterpart, or can only follow what it publishes, is a fact about people and agreements. **A
  repository cannot tell you which, however carefully you read it.**

So for ownership: **gather the evidence, present the candidates, and let a human choose.** Writing a
label on your own authority produces a map that looks authoritative and is not — and the next reader
has no way to tell which labels were established and which were guessed.

## Step 0 — Confirm the scope

One `AskUserQuestion`:

- 「地図のスコープを選んでください」
  - 「変更で触れた口のみ」 — the entry points and outbound calls in the diff
  - 「全体」 — re-enumerate every contact point
  - 「1 つの辺」 — one counterpart, added or revised

## Step 1 — Enumerate the contact points from the code

**Enumerate; do not recall.** The map is only worth its enumeration.

| Where to look | What it yields |
| --- | --- |
| `src/config/` | The purpose-scoped modules. **Each one that names an outside destination is an edge**, and its module is where the address actually lives ([0030](../../../docs/adr/0030-environment-variable-management.md)) |
| `src/adapters/` | The outbound clients and the transport, and whether a generated type is involved |
| `src/app/api/**` | The inbound entry points this repository owns |
| `src/app` metadata / `robots` / `sitemap` | The inbound edges that are standards rather than callers |
| `src/proxy.ts` | What is intercepted before any of the above runs |

<!-- sample:begin -->
**Separate the edges the sample purge removes from the ones that survive.** A counterpart that only
exists because the sample does is not part of the map a template user receives — the range is
[`scripts/setup/remove-sample/sample-manifest.ts`](../../../scripts/setup/remove-sample/sample-manifest.ts).

<!-- sample:end -->
**Count contact points by counterpart, not by resource.** Ten endpoints against one backend are one
edge; the map is about who this layer talks to, not about what it asks them.

## Step 2 — Settle 翻案 from the dependency matrix

For each edge, read [`architecture.ts`](../../../architecture.ts) and answer: **can the outside
vocabulary reach the inside without being rewritten?**

- A generated wire type confined to the `adapters-gen` area, reachable only from `adapters` →
  **翻案あり**. It is structurally impossible for the outside shape to arrive unchanged.
- An external format carried through as-is because a standard says so — a signal envelope forwarded
  without being read, a URL composed and handed on → **翻案なし**.

**Cite the rule, not the impression.** This axis is a fact about the matrix, and a reader must be
able to check it without trusting you.

## Step 3 — Gather the evidence for 所有, then ask

For each edge, assemble what is actually knowable and present it:

- **Who publishes the contract** — a standard body, the counterpart, or this repository.
- **What happens here when it changes** — does this side have to follow, or is the shape ours?
- **Whether a version or a negotiation exists** — a versioned contract, or a moving target.

Then ask. Phrase the options as **readings of the relationship**, not as labels:

```text
質問: <相手> との境界は、どちらが決めますか？
選択肢:
  - 相手が決める（こちらは追従する）
  - こちらが決める（口の形をこのリポジトリが持つ）
  - 標準が決める（どちらも仕様に従う）
  - どれでもない / まだ分からない
```

**Include the last option.** An edge whose ownership nobody can state yet is a real answer, and
recording it as 未確定 is more useful than a label that was picked to fill the cell.

## Step 4 — Write the map, and only the map

Write [`docs/design/context-map.md`](../../../docs/design/context-map.md). Per edge: the counterpart,
the ownership, the translation, where the contract comes from, and **which document owns the
mechanism**.

**Do not write the mechanism here.** How the edge is connected, what is sent, how failure is folded —
each of those belongs to the subject reference that already owns it. **A map that restates them goes
stale in two places at once**, and the map is the copy that nobody re-reads.

**Do not edit those subject references.** When the mechanism has changed, that is their maintainer's
change, not this skill's.

The map is the English canonical on the suffix-less path, and its Japanese mirror is
the sibling `context-map.ja.md` ([0140](../../../docs/adr/0140-documentation-operations.md), the
canonical language model). Write the canonical, then chain `canonicalize-doc` to sync the mirror in the same
change. Then format only what this skill wrote:

```bash
pnpm exec markdownlint-cli2 --no-globs --fix docs/design/context-map.md
```

## Step 5 — Closing report (Japanese)

State the edges added, revised, and removed; which ownerships the user settled and which are 未確定;
and **which edges were sample-only and therefore not recorded**. Name the scope.

## AI Modification Scope

Invoking this skill relaxes `AGENTS.md`'s modification scope to `docs/design/context-map.md` alone
(its mirror is written by the chained `canonicalize-doc`), for the duration of this run. The subject references, the ADRs, and `src/config/` stay protected.

## Do / Do NOT

- ✅ Enumerate contact points from the code, never from memory.
- ✅ Count by counterpart, not by resource.
- ✅ Separate the sample-only edges from the ones that survive.
- ✅ Settle 翻案 from the dependency matrix and cite the rule.
- ✅ Present ownership as evidenced candidates and let a human choose.
- ✅ Offer 「どれでもない / まだ分からない」 and record 未確定 when it is chosen.
- ✅ Point at the document that owns each mechanism.
- ✅ Report in Japanese.
- ❌ Write an ownership label on your own authority.
- ❌ Infer ownership from the code — it is not in there.
- ❌ Restate a mechanism the subject reference owns.
- ❌ Edit a subject reference, an ADR, or `src/config/`.
- ❌ Use the relationship vocabulary of a modelling method this repository does not adopt.
- ❌ Edit the `.ja.md` mirror by hand; run a gate.

## Checklist

- [ ] 翻案 settled from `architecture.ts`, with the rule cited.
- [ ] 所有 presented as evidenced candidates and chosen by the user; 未確定 recorded where chosen.
