usage-class: situational
description: Create or sync a canonical English / Japanese translation pair for a specified README, SKILL, or similar Markdown document. Detects the existing file (canonical, translation, or both), confirms the source file and direction with the user via AskUserQuestion, and produces the missing side or syncs both sides while preserving repo conventions (frontmatter rules for SKILL files, sync-note headers for translations, cross-reference links).

# Canonicalize Doc

This skill produces or synchronizes a paired English (canonical) / Japanese (translation) Markdown document set, following the conventions used in this repository.

A Japanese reference translation of this skill is available at `SKILL.ja.md` in the same directory (not loaded as a skill; for human reference only).

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- A Japanese-only Markdown doc exists and you need to produce the English canonical version (the typical case here — see Repo Conventions › Language).
- An English-only Markdown doc exists and you need to produce its Japanese translation.
- Both versions exist but have drifted apart and need to be synchronized.

Supported document types:

- Claude Code skill files: `SKILL.md` / `SKILL.ja.md` (under `.claude/skills/<name>/`)
- READMEs: `README.md` / `README.ja.md` (co-located in the same directory, e.g. `docker/`)
- Generic Markdown docs with the `*.ja.md` suffix convention (co-located).
- `docs/**` documents using the parallel directory convention (`docs/**/foo.md` and `docs/ja/**/foo.ja.md`). <!-- skill-lint-ignore -->

## Step 0. Confirm Input

This skill **MUST call `AskUserQuestion` immediately after invocation** to confirm:

1. **Source file path** — the file the user is pointing at (canonical or translation).
2. **Direction** — what to produce:
    - `canonical-from-translation`: translate the Japanese into English and create the canonical file.
    - `translation-from-canonical`: translate the English into Japanese and create the translation file.
    - `sync-both`: both files exist; reconcile differences and rewrite the side that should be updated.

Procedure:

1. If the user supplied a file path in skill arguments or the most recent message, include it as a candidate.
2. Inspect the surrounding directory to detect the counterpart file (if any) and the convention being used (co-located `*.ja.md` vs `docs/ja/**` parallel tree).
3. Call `AskUserQuestion` with:
    - Question 1: "Confirm the source file path." (include the detected candidate)
    - Question 2: "Which direction? (canonical-from-translation / translation-from-canonical / sync-both)" — include the recommended option based on what files already exist.
    - If `sync-both`, also ask: "Which side is the source of truth for this sync?"

Do NOT read or write any files for translation until the source path and direction are confirmed.

## Repo Conventions

Apply these rules when producing each side of the pair.

### Language

**A pair exists in exactly two places: `.claude/skills/<name>/`, and `AGENTS.md` /
`AGENTS.ja.md` at the repo root.** ADR
[0140](../../../docs/adr/0140-documentation-operations.md) keeps Japanese canonical on the
suffix-less path and forbids creating a `*.ja.md` beside it — but that ban reaches only documents
whose canonical is Japanese. These two are English canonical for reasons their own ADRs own (0154
for `SKILL.md`, 0152 for `AGENTS.md`), so a sibling mirror is correct there. Everywhere else a
README or a `docs/**` document has **no translation to sync** — running this skill on one would
create the very file 0140 forbids. Verify before assuming otherwise: `find src docs -name '*.ja.md'`
returns nothing today.

- **For a `SKILL` pair — English is canonical.** The English file is the source of truth, and
  `SKILL.ja.md` is the translation kept in sync with it.
- **For the `AGENTS` pair — English is canonical, and only the mirror may be written.** `AGENTS.md`
  stays protected during this skill's run (below), so the only direction this skill may take on it
  is `translation-from-canonical`. `scripts/skill-lint` checks the two for a 1:1 heading structure;
  what it cannot judge — whether the translation says the same thing — is this skill's job.
- **Everywhere else — Japanese on the suffix-less path is canonical, and there is no translation.**
  The EN-canonical + `docs/ja/**` mirror described under *Targets* is the shape 0140 **switches
  to**, not the shape in force now. Read 0140 for which side is in force before writing.

### SKILL files (`.claude/skills/<name>/`)

- `SKILL.md` (canonical, English):
  - MUST include YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields.
  - `description` should be in English and written to maximize skill-selection accuracy.
  - Include a one-line pointer near the top: `A Japanese reference translation of this skill is available at SKILL.ja.md in the same directory (not loaded as a skill; for human reference only).`
- `SKILL.ja.md` (translation, Japanese):
  - MUST NOT include YAML frontmatter (frontmatter would risk being misinterpreted by tooling; only `SKILL.md` is loaded as a skill, but keeping it absent removes any ambiguity).
  - MUST begin with a blockquote header in Japanese stating that it is a translation, that direct edits are forbidden, and that updates flow from `SKILL.md`.

### README and generic docs

- `README.md` / `README.ja.md` (co-located in the same directory):
  - No frontmatter requirements.
  - The translation file should begin with a short note that it is a translation of the canonical file.
  - The canonical file may optionally link to the translation (`See [README.ja.md](README.ja.md) for the Japanese version.`).

### `docs/**` parallel-tree docs

- Canonical: `docs/<path>/<name>.md`
- Translation: `docs/ja/<path>/<name>.ja.md`
- Keep section structure, headings, and link targets 1:1 between the two files.

## AI Modification Scope

Per the "Exception: Skill Execution" clause in AGENTS.md, the normal AI Modification Scope restrictions are relaxed during this skill's execution, scoped to the specific document pair the user confirmed in the first step.

Paths that may be modified:

- The confirmed source file.
- Its counterpart file (created or rewritten).
- Nothing else.

The following remain protected even during skill execution:

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
- Generated files — the paths `.gitattributes` declares `linguist-generated` (`git check-attr linguist-generated -- <path>`), and generated content under `docs/`
- Any path listed under `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json`

## Step 1. Read the source

Read the confirmed source file in full. If the direction is `sync-both`, read both files.

## Step 2. Determine the output path

- `canonical-from-translation`:
  - `foo.ja.md` → `foo.md` in the same directory.
  - `docs/ja/<path>/<name>.ja.md` → `docs/<path>/<name>.md`.
- `translation-from-canonical`:
  - `foo.md` → `foo.ja.md` in the same directory.
  - `docs/<path>/<name>.md` → `docs/ja/<path>/<name>.ja.md`.
- `sync-both`:
  - Rewrite the non-source-of-truth side.

## Step 3. Translate (or sync)

- Preserve heading structure, list nesting, code blocks, and link targets exactly.
- Translate prose, comments within code blocks (only if originally translated), and inline text.
- Do NOT translate: identifiers, file paths, command invocations, code samples (unless they contain natural-language strings that were originally translated).
- For SKILL files, also apply the frontmatter and sync-note rules described in "Repo Conventions" above.

## Step 4. Write the output

- Write the produced file to its target path.
- If both files exist and the user chose `sync-both`, write only to the non-source-of-truth side.

## Step 5. Add cross-references

- If creating a `SKILL.md`, ensure it contains the one-line pointer to `SKILL.ja.md`.
- If creating a `SKILL.ja.md`, ensure the leading blockquote sync note is present.
- For README pairs, add the link from canonical to translation only if requested.

## Step 6. Verify

- Diff section counts and heading text between the two files; they should match 1:1.
- Confirm code blocks are byte-identical (except where prose was translated inside them).
- Report any sections that could not be cleanly mapped and ask the user how to resolve them.

## Step 7. Format the written files

After writing the produced file (and the synced side in `sync-both` mode), run `pnpm exec markdownlint-cli2 --no-globs --fix <paths you wrote>` on the files this skill produced. Leave `pnpm lint:md` to the pre-commit hook and CI (AGENTS.md: do not pre-run the gates).

## Checklist

Confirm the following before reporting completion:

- [ ] Source file path confirmed with the user via `AskUserQuestion`
- [ ] Direction (`canonical-from-translation` / `translation-from-canonical` / `sync-both`) confirmed
- [ ] If `sync-both`, source-of-truth side confirmed
- [ ] Output file path follows the repo convention for that doc type
- [ ] Frontmatter rules applied correctly (canonical SKILL has it; translation SKILL does not)
- [ ] Translation sync-note header present in `*.ja.md` SKILL files
- [ ] Section structure and code blocks match 1:1
- [ ] `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` was run on the written files only
- [ ] No unintended files modified outside the confirmed pair

## Notes

- Do NOT modify files outside the confirmed document pair.
- Do NOT translate identifiers, file paths, commands, or other technical tokens.
- When translating to Japanese, follow AGENTS.md's "Output Language" rule (Japanese for human-visible prose); when translating to English, prefer concise, declarative wording suitable for AI skill descriptions.
- If the user asks for a doc type not listed in "Supported document types", confirm the intended naming convention before proceeding.
