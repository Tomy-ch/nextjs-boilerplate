name: comment-sweep
description: >-
  Sweep the accumulated stock of source-code comments in a chosen scope and decide whether each comment's content **belongs where it sits** — the jurisdiction question no other reviewer in this repository asks — and, reading each file's comments as one body, which single site owns a Why that has been written in several of them. It is the sole owner of the comment subject: no review skill carries a comment lens, and this one runs over accumulated code with the two verdicts a diff-scoped reader cannot reach — **移設** (relocate a design rationale out of the comment and into the ADR or the layer README that owns it, leaving only the operative residue plus a one-line reference, while refusing the two classic misroutes: a library's specific behavior stays in the code, and business knowledge goes to the feature's own README, never to an ADR) and **集約** (a set-valued verdict for duplication, fragmentation, and aggregate over-explanation inside one file: one site keeps the content, the rest shrink to a pointer, approved as a single indivisible decision). Use it whenever comments feel bloated, verbose, or essay-like even though every line is individually true; whenever the same reason appears at several declarations and no one place is authoritative; when a doc comment has grown into a design argument or a rejected-alternative discussion; when the same rationale appears in both an ADR and the code that follows it; for a periodic hygiene sweep of a kernel, a feature, or `scripts/`; before a release or a fork cut where accumulated commentary would burden downstream readers; and when someone asks 「コメントが長すぎる」「コメントを整理して」「この Why はコードに置くべきか」「根拠を ADR に移したい」. It reads the comment standard at runtime — `docs/rules.md` if it grows a Comment Rules section, otherwise `AGENTS.md` plus the standard embedded in `.claude/agents/comment-reviewer.md` — and hardcodes no policy. It then applies the result in one of three modes, picked in Step 0 or fixed by a flag — 確認して適用 (default; approval per verdict group, then write), 自動適用 (`--apply`; writes 削除 / 書換 / high-confidence 集約 with no approval prompt and withholds every 移設 that needs a document write, because creating an ADR is a call `AGENTS.md` reserves for a prior user instruction and a no-question mode has no way to ask it), and 報告のみ (`--report-only`; renders every finding in full and writes nothing) — performing the code **and** destination-document writes itself, so a relocated rationale never loses its home. It is invoked in its own right, never from inside another review skill: `/impl-review` (the change) and `/test-review` (the tests) are its peers under the Review Phase Protocol in `AGENTS.md`, asked for separately and never delegating to one another. Do NOT use it to judge README / docs prose quality (`doc-reviewer`), to fix README↔code structural drift (`sync-readme` / `back-prop`), or to review implementation or tests (`impl-review` / `test-review`).

# Comment Sweep

Judge accumulated comments on one question the existing reviewers cannot ask: **does this content
belong here?**

A Japanese reference translation of this skill is available at `SKILL.ja.md` in the same directory
(not loaded as a skill; for human reference only).

## When to Use

- Comments in a directory feel bloated or essay-like even though each line is individually true.
- A doc comment has grown into a design argument, a threat-model discussion, or a rejected-alternative
  list.
- The same rationale appears in both an ADR and the code that follows it — one of the two is going to
  rot, and it will be the one nobody re-reads.
- A periodic hygiene sweep of a kernel, a feature, or `scripts/`.
- Before a release or a fork cut, where accumulated commentary becomes someone else's burden.

## Do NOT use this skill for

- **README / docs prose quality** — `doc-reviewer`.
- **README ↔ code structural drift** — `sync-readme` / `back-prop`.
- **Implementation or test review** — `impl-review` / `test-review`.

## Why this skill exists

A reader who judges comments one change at a time can answer only **削除** (the content should not
exist) or **書換** (the content is right but said badly). A third case is common and neither verdict
fits: **the content is correct and worth keeping, but it does not belong in a comment.**

That verdict is **移設**, and it cannot live in a read-only reviewer for two reasons. It requires
*writing the destination document*, which a reviewer must not do. And it is a judgment over the
accumulated stock rather than over one diff — the same rationale duplicated across an ADR and five
call sites is invisible when you only look at what changed.

### The second question: what one comment at a time cannot see

Jurisdiction is asked of a single comment, and that leaves a blind spot of the same shape. When one
Why is written at three declarations, **each copy passes the jurisdiction test on its own** — each is
non-obvious, each sits at the site whose premise it states, each is individually defensible. Judged
one at a time they are three 維持. The redundancy exists only in the relation between them, so a
per-comment pass cannot find it however carefully it is run.

So every sweep asks a second question of each file's comment stock as a unit:

> **Is this content already carried somewhere else in this file, and if so, which single site owns it?**

Three shapes answer to it, and none is reachable per comment:

- **重複** — one Why restated at several declarations. One site owns the concept; the rest shrink to a
  pointer.
- **分散** — a constraint split across declarations so that no single place states it and a reader has
  to assemble it. The fix is to make one site whole, never to add another fragment.
- **総量過多** — every comment is individually correct, yet the file's total commentary costs more to
  read than the code it explains.

This is the same trap as the diff-scope one, one level down: the argument for keeping each copy wins
every time it is asked in isolation, so nothing ever consolidates. Ask it of the set instead.

## What this skill reads

Read **at runtime**. Hardcode no policy — the standard moves and this file must not become a stale
copy of it.

| Source | What it decides |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/rules.md` | **If it carries a Comment Rules section, that is the standard.** At the time of writing it does not; check rather than assume |
| `AGENTS.md` | Language Rules (comments are Japanese) and Code Style |
| `.claude/agents/comment-reviewer.md` | The content standard currently in force — What + a constraint whose premise sits at that call site, never How |
| `docs/adr/` | The candidate destinations, and what each ADR already says |
| The layer / feature `README.md` above the swept path | The other candidate destination, and its declared responsibilities |

## Step 0. Resolve the scope and the apply mode

One `AskUserQuestion` call carrying **two** questions. Skip whichever one the argument or a flag
already answers; skip the call entirely when both are fixed.

- 「comment-sweep の対象スコープを選んでください」
  - 「変更で触れたファイル」 — sweep the files a change touched, **whole**
  - 「1 カーネル / 1 feature」 — e.g. `src/adapters/`, `src/features/<name>/`
  - 「`scripts/` の 1 ツール」
  - 「パスを指定」
- 「検出結果をどう適用しますか？」
  - 「判定の束ごとに確認して書き換える」 ← default
  - 「そのまま書き換える（確認を取らない。文書書き込みを伴う移設は対象外）」
  - 「報告のみ（書き込まない）」

**Sweep one directory at a time.** A repository-wide sweep produces an approval queue nobody
finishes, and a half-finished queue is worse than none — the reader cannot tell swept from unswept.

### Apply modes

| Mode | Selected by | What Steps 3–4 do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 確認して適用 | the default option, or `mode: confirm` | Step 3 takes approval per verdict group, then Step 4 writes — every verdict is reachable |
| 自動適用 | `--apply`, or the second option | Step 4 writes 削除 / 書換 / high-confidence 集約 with no approval prompt; a 移設 that needs a document write is reported, not applied |
| 報告のみ | `--report-only`, or `mode: report` | Step 3 renders the findings in full and the run ends; nothing is written |

### Flags

- `--apply` — 自動適用. Fixes the mode, so the mode question is not asked.
- `--report-only` — 報告のみ. Detect and report; never write.
- Both at once is a contradiction, not a precedence puzzle: say so and fall back to the mode
  question rather than silently picking one.

## Step 1. Read the standard and the destinations

1. Read the comment standard (see the table above) — this run, not from memory.
2. Read the `README.md` above the scope, and the ADRs it references.
3. Read every file in scope, comments **and** the code under them. A jurisdiction call cannot be made
   from the comment alone: whether the premise sits at this call site is a fact about the code.

## Step 2. Classify every comment in scope

Run **both passes** over the same files. They find different things and neither substitutes for the
other: pass 1 asks jurisdiction of each comment, pass 2 asks ownership of each file's stock. Pass 2
reads no extra material — what it adds is a question — so run it on every file, including the ones
where pass 1 found nothing. A file whose comments are all individually fine is exactly where
duplication hides.

Five verdicts. The first three already exist; the last two are what this skill adds.

| 判定 | Pass | When | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **維持** | 1 | A correct What, or a constraint whose premise sits at that call site | Leave it |
| **削除** | 1 | How-narration, restatement, 経緯, tautology, a marker the code already satisfies | Remove |
| **書換** | 1 | Right content, wrong wording — drifted, ambiguous, or longer than the fact it delivers | Rewrite in place |
| **移設** | 1 | Correct and worth keeping, but its premise is **not** at this call site and its reversal would oblige someone to update a document | Move it to that document; leave the operative residue and a one-line reference |
| **集約** | 2 | The same content is carried at several sites in one file (重複 / 分散 / 総量過多) | One site keeps it; the rest shrink to a pointer |

**The 移設 test**: could someone make this statement false without editing this declaration? If yes,
nobody here can verify it and nothing will flag it when it turns false. Ask where it *would* be
checked — that place is its home.

**A comment is reported once.** When a comment is both individually shortenable and a member of a
集約 set, the **集約 wins** and absorbs the shortening — otherwise the same line is put to the user
twice under two verdicts that partly contradict each other.

### What a 集約 finding must contain

集約 is the only verdict whose subject is a **set**, and everything below is what makes the set
decidable as one unit. A 集約 missing any of it is not reviewable:

1. **The shape** — 重複 / 分散 / 総量過多. They fail differently, so the shape is what tells the
   reviewer what to check.
2. **Every member** — each `file:line` and its comment in full. Not only the site you propose to
   keep: a consolidation cannot be judged from the winner alone.
3. **The owning site, with evidence** — which declaration keeps the content, and *why that one*. The
   test is ownership of the concept, not comment length or file order: the site a reader arrives at
   first when they ask the question the comment answers. A wrong pick is the expensive failure here,
   because the other sites are already shrunk by the time it shows.
4. **The consolidated wording** — the full text the owning site will carry. It must cover what the
   shrunk sites gave up; a consolidation that quietly drops one member's distinct fact is a deletion
   wearing another verdict's name.
5. **Each pointer** — the exact residue left at every other site. A bare 「詳細は上記参照」 is not a
   pointer; name the declaration, so a reader who jumped straight to that line can navigate.
6. **確度: high / medium / low** — load-bearing, not decorative. 自動適用 applies a 集約 only at
   `high`, so rate honestly: `high` means you can point to the sentences that state the same fact and
   to the declaration that owns the concept. Uncertainty about which site should win is `medium` at
   best.

**A 集約 never writes a document** — it only moves content between comments inside one file. When the
right home turns out to be prose outside the code, that is a **移設**, and the two are not mixed in
one finding.

### Where things go, and the two misroutes to refuse

| Content | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| A decision about structure, mechanism, or policy | The ADR that owns that area |
| What a layer / feature accepts and refuses | That directory's `README.md` |
| A constraint whose premise sits at the call site | **Stays in the code** |

Two misroutes are common enough to name:

- **A library's specific behavior stays in the code.** "This API returns `null` rather than throwing
  when the key is absent" is a fact about the call site, not a decision. Moving it to an ADR buries a
  detail the next editor needs at exactly the place they are editing.
- **Business knowledge does not go to an ADR.** Why a purchase can be cancelled before shipping is
  the feature's knowledge; it belongs in that feature's README (or the backend's contract), not in a
  record of architectural decisions. An ADR that accumulates business rules stops being readable as
  a decision log.

Classification is **mode-independent**. Produce every finding, in full, whatever Step 0 resolved —
the entire difference between the three modes lives in Steps 3–5. A run that classified less because
it was only going to report would quietly disagree with a run that classified in order to apply, and
nothing exists to detect that drift.

## Step 3. Drive the approval loop

Present the findings **grouped by verdict**, most consequential first (移設 → 削除 → 書換), each with:

- `file:line` and the comment verbatim
- the verdict and the one-sentence reason
- for 移設: the destination file, and the exact text proposed for it
- the residue proposed for the code (never leave the call site silent when a constraint remains)

In **確認して適用**, confirm with `AskUserQuestion` per group: 「この判定で適用しますか？」 /
「個別に確認したい」 / 「この分類は見送る」. A sweep that applies 40 edits on one confirmation is not
reviewable. In **自動適用**, take no confirmation here — Step 4 states afterwards what it wrote.

**A 集約 is one question covering the whole set, never one per member.** Splitting it produces
outcomes the user never chose: approve the shrinks without the surviving site and the Why is gone;
approve the survivor without the shrinks and nothing consolidated. Offer 集約 /
「現状のまま（維持）」 / 「別の site を本体にする」 / 「判断を保留」, and show every member.

**In 報告のみ the run ends here**, and the grouped summary above is not enough on its own. Render
every non-`維持` finding in full — the evidence, the comment before and after, and for a 移設 the
exact prose proposed for the destination — because no approval loop follows to reveal them one at a
time. Close by saying how to act on the report: re-run with `--apply` for the 削除 / 書換, or in
確認して適用 for those plus the 移設. For a 集約, render every member comment and not only the site
that keeps the content — a consolidation cannot be judged from the winner alone.

## Step 4. Apply — code and destination together

Not reached in 報告のみ. Between the other two modes the write itself is identical; what differs is
who approves it, and how much of the verdict set is in play.

### 自動適用 — no approval prompt

Apply **削除**, **書換**, and **集約** as Step 2 classified them, in one pass, and report what was
written. Three exclusions come off that set first:

- **A finding whose comment contradicts the code** is reported, never applied. Which side is wrong —
  the comment or the code — is not a comment-cleanup call, and deleting the comment can erase the
  only surviving evidence of a bug. The guard below already says to stop there; unattended, it is
  the difference between a report and a defect nobody hears about again.
- **A 移設 whose destination already states the content** is applied only after opening that document
  and confirming the content is actually there. With a human in the loop that claim is checked at
  approval time; unattended, a misread section would strip the rationale out of the code and point
  the residue at a document that never says it. When the check fails, report the finding instead of
  applying it. A 移設 that survives the check writes no document — it is really a shortening down to
  the residue plus a reference.
- **A 集約 is applied only at `確度: high`.** A 書換 risks the wrong wording at one site; a
  consolidation additionally picks *which declaration owns the concept*, and it has already shrunk
  the other sites by the time a wrong pick becomes visible. That is markedly harder to undo, so
  anything rated `medium` or `low` is reported for 確認して適用 instead of applied.

**Do not apply a 移設 that would write to a destination document.** Report those with their count and
proposed landing form, and say that 確認して適用 is where they land. The reason is not caution in
general: `AGENTS.md`'s *AI Modification Scope* permits editing `docs/adr/BACKLOG.md` but reserves
**ADR file creation for a prior user instruction**, and whether a rationale becomes a new record or a
rewrite of an existing one is exactly that call. A mode whose contract is "no questions" has no way
to ask it. Keeping that one question alive would break the contract; answering it silently would
settle a repository-policy question by generator.

Every guard below still holds. 自動適用 removes the prompt, not the rules.

### 確認して適用 — write what each approved group asked for

For each approved item, write **both sides in the same step**:

1. Append the relocated rationale to the destination document, in that document's voice and section
   structure. Do not paste the comment verbatim — a comment and a document read differently.
2. Edit the code: remove the relocated prose, keep the operative residue, and add a one-line
   reference to the destination.

Never do one without the other. A rationale removed from code before its destination exists is
information destroyed, and this skill is the only thing holding both ends.

Guards that hold regardless of approval or mode:

- **Never remove a functional directive** — `// @ts-expect-error`, `// biome-ignore …`,
  `// eslint-disable*`, `/** @jsxImportSource … */`, `// Code generated … DO NOT EDIT`, shebangs.
  (`"use client"` / `"use server"` are string directives, not comments — never touch them.)
- **Never edit a protected path.** `AGENTS.md`, `LICENSE`, and anything under
  `.claude/settings.json`'s `permissions.deny` stay untouched. Accepted ADR bodies are editable below
  v1.0.0 and are a normal destination; above it they need approval like any other ADR edit.
- **Never touch generated files** — `**/gen/**`, anything with a generated banner.
- **Do not rewrite the code's behavior.** This skill moves prose. If a comment is wrong because the
  code is wrong, report it and stop.

## Step 5. Verify

Run this only when something was written. 報告のみ has nothing to verify; 自動適用 needs it most,
because nobody read the edits one at a time.

```sh
pnpm fix
pnpm lint:ci
pnpm md-lint
```

Then re-read the diff of the touched files and confirm only comments and documents changed. Behavior
must be untouched; if `git diff` shows a statement changed, that is a defect in this run.

**After a 集約, read the whole file top to bottom** rather than each edited site in isolation — the
finding was about the file, so the check has to be too. Two failures show up only this way: the
surviving site does not actually carry what the shrunk ones gave up, and a pointer names a
declaration a reader cannot find from where they are standing.

## Step 6. Report

State per file what was 維持 / 削除 / 書換 / 移設 / 集約, and where each relocation landed. **Count a
集約 once, not once per member**, and report the member count beside it so the size of the edit is
visible before anyone approves it. Say plainly what
was **not** swept — a directory left for later, a finding deferred because it needed a design call.
An unstated omission reads as "this directory is clean" when it is not.

In **自動適用**, name every finding that was withheld and why — a comment that contradicts the code, a
移設 that needs a document write, a 移設 whose destination could not be confirmed. A withheld finding
that goes unmentioned reads as one that was never raised.

## Relationship to the other review skills

This skill owns the **comments**, and it owns them alone: no review skill carries a comment lens, and
this one is invoked in its own right rather than from inside another. `/impl-review` (the change) and
`/test-review` (the tests) are its peers under the Review Phase Protocol in `AGENTS.md` — asked for
separately, decided separately, and never delegating to one another.
