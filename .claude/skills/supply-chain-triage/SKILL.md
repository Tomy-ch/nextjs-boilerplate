# Supply-chain Triage

This skill answers one question about one artifact version: **is there direct evidence that this
release is a compromised publish?** It produces a scored, cited verdict and changes nothing.

It exists because of a property the security ADR records: **the window is a proxy, and a proxy can be
discharged by direct evidence.** Waiting N days is a cheap stand-in for four questions. Answering
them beats counting days — **skipping both does not.**

[0110](../../../docs/adr/0110-security-operations.md) is the **source of truth** for that reasoning.
Read it at runtime rather than trusting this paragraph: the policy lives there, and this skill is
only its instrument.

That last clause is the design constraint that shapes everything here: **an axis you could not answer
is not a passing grade.** A verdict is a claim about evidence obtained, so this skill reports
「未回答」 explicitly and refuses to launder silence into a low score.

A Japanese reference translation lives at `SKILL.ja.md` in this directory (for human reference only;
not loaded as a skill). The per-ecosystem procedures under `references/` are English only — they are
command recipes, not prose for human readers.

## When to Use

- A cooldown window caught a candidate and someone must decide whether to wait: `tools-upgrade`
  classified a release pending, `actions-pin` had to step back or hold, `images-pin` held on a tag.
- `make tools-cooldown-check` fails on a `mise.toml` pin. That gate **fails the build**, so the
  question is not whether an override slipped through but whether waiting is protective.
- A Dependabot security update wants to skip the window, and someone must decide whether taking a
  same-day publish is worth it.
- Before any deliberate window override. **Overriding without evidence is the one combination
  [0110](../../../docs/adr/0110-security-operations.md) rules out.**
- The user asks, in any phrasing, whether a specific release is safe to take.

## Contract

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Owns** | 1 つの版についての直接証拠の収集と採点、未回答軸の明示、判断者への引き渡し |
| **Never** | lockfile / pin / 窓の編集 / 版の採用 / 成果物の実行 / 取れなかった証拠を `0` に数えること |
| **Starts when** | 窓が候補を捕まえ、待つべきかを人が決める必要があるとき |
| **Stops when** | 4 軸を試み終えたとき。採点を渡して終わる —— 採用の判断はしない |

## Do NOT use this skill for

- Performing the upgrade — `tools-upgrade` / `actions-pin` / `images-pin`, or the Dependabot PR.
  This skill only reports.
- Scanning first-party code for defects — `impl-review` and the SAST gates.
- **A routine image hold.** For a mutable tag two of the four axes are usually unanswerable (there is
  no source diff for a rebuild), so triage will normally confirm the hold rather than discharge it.
  Run it there only when the decision actually needs it.

## Hard limits

These are what make the skill safe to invoke on a possibly-malicious artifact.

- **Report-only.** Never edit `mise.toml`, `.github/actions-pin.toml`, `docker/images-pin.toml`,
  `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, or a lockfile. Never re-run a caller's resolve / apply.
  Never lower a window yourself. **A low score is evidence handed to a decision-maker, not a
  decision.**
- **Never execute the artifact.** Download and read; do not install, build, or run it. **Running an
  install script *is* the attack** for a registry package, so fetch the tarball and unpack it — never
  `pnpm add` / `pnpm install` the candidate, and never `pnpm dlx` it. Never run a downloaded binary,
  and never pull-and-run a quarantined image.
- **`npm` is not available here.** [0001](../../../docs/adr/0001-package-manager.md) adopts pnpm and
  forbids npm outright, so the registry is queried with `pnpm view` and the tarball is fetched with
  `curl`. The recipes under `references/` use those.
- **Work outside the repo tree.** Extract artifacts into the session scratchpad, never into the
  working tree, so nothing you fetched can be committed by accident.
- **Cite or drop.** Every axis score carries the command and the observation it rests on. **An
  unsupported hunch is reported as unanswerable, not as a score.**

## The four evidence axes

Score each axis `0`–`3`, or mark it `?` when the evidence is not obtainable for this ecosystem or
artifact. **Higher is worse.** The per-ecosystem recipes in `references/` say how to obtain each one.

| Axis | Question | What a `0` looks like |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P** — Publisher | Did the publisher change? | Same maintainer / committer / owner as the baseline, with a publishing cadence in line with history |
| **A** — Attestation | Does the artifact match its source? | Provenance or transparency-log evidence ties the artifact to a named source commit, and that commit is on the upstream default branch |
| **D** — Diff | What actually changed? | The diff against the baseline is read in full, is proportionate to the release notes, and contains none of the signatures below |
| **S** — Surface | Did new dependencies or capabilities appear? | No new dependency, no new `bin` / entrypoint / packaged path, no widened permissions |

Score on what the evidence says, not on how it feels:

- `0` — answered, and the answer is continuity or benign change.
- `1` — answered and benign overall, but one detail is unexplained.
- `2` — answered, and something is off in a way the release notes do not account for.
- `3` — a compromise signature below is present, or the axis is answered adversely (the publisher
  changed to an unknown account; the artifact does not match the tag; a tag already trusted now
  resolves to a different commit).
- `?` — not obtainable. Say why in one clause. **Never substitute `0`.**

**The baseline is the version the caller would otherwise keep** — the currently-pinned SHA, the
locked version, the installed one — not simply the previous release in the registry. The question
being answered is 「移ることで何を引き受けるのか」, so the diff has to span exactly the move under
consideration.

### Compromise signatures (the teeth of axis D)

These are what a malicious publish has actually looked like. **Read for them specifically; a diff
skimmed for 「妥当そうか」 catches nothing.**

- **Install / lifecycle hooks** added or altered — `preinstall` / `install` / `postinstall`, an
  `action.yml` gaining a `run:` step. Code that executes before anyone reviews it. <!-- skill-lint-ignore -->
  (The file belongs to the upstream Action, never to this repository.)
- **Credential and secret access** — `process.env`, the npm auth file, cloud credential paths,
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`, SSH keys, the runner's memory.
- **New outbound network calls**, particularly to a raw IP, a URL shortener, a paste service, a
  webhook sink, or any domain unrelated to the project's own infrastructure.
- **Obfuscation** — packed or minified source in a package that otherwise ships readable code, long
  base64 / hex literals, `eval` / `new Function`, string-array decoders, code hidden behind an
  unusual platform check.
- **Shelling out** — `child_process`, `curl | sh`, in something with no reason to spawn a process.
- **A bundled artifact that outruns its source** — for a JS action or a package shipping a build
  output, **a bundle diff with no corresponding source change is the highest-signal finding
  available**, because the bundle is what runs and the source is what gets reviewed.
- **Widened packaging or capability surface** — new `files` / `bin` entries, a new entrypoint, added
  `permissions`, a new binary or blob.
- **Disproportion** — a 「typo 修正」 release carrying a 400-line diff, or a package dormant for two
  years publishing twice in a day.

## Bands and the two overrides

Sum the answered axes:

| Sum | Band |
| --- | --- |
| 0–2 | **LOW** |
| 3–5 | **MEDIUM** |
| 6–8 | **HIGH** |
| 9–12 | **CRITICAL** |

Two rules override the sum, because **averaging is the wrong operation for this data**:

1. **Any axis at `3` floors the band at HIGH.** One confirmed red flag is not diluted by three clean
   axes — **a compromised publish is usually clean everywhere except the payload.**
2. **Unanswered axes cap the claim.** Two or more `?` → report **INSUFFICIENT-EVIDENCE** with no
   band: the proxy was not discharged, so the window simply stands. Exactly one `?` → compute the
   band but cap it at MEDIUM, because LOW asserts positive evidence on all four questions and you
   have three.

### Exposure is reported next to the score, never folded into it

The score measures **how likely this publish is malicious**. How much damage it would do is a
different quantity, and [0110](../../../docs/adr/0110-security-operations.md) is explicit that window
length tracks upstream detection latency rather than blast radius — **mixing them corrupts both
numbers.** Report exposure as a separate line:

- **Executes in CI with the job's credentials before our code does** — a GitHub Action, a container
  image used by a workflow, a package with an install script. Highest; a compromise here reaches
  secrets directly.
- **Shipped to the browser or linked into the running server** — a runtime dependency.
- **Build / dev-time only** — a generator, a linter, a `mise`-managed CLI. **A tool that distributes
  agent skills sits above this line rather than on it**: it runs with the developer's privileges on a
  workstation holding repository write access, and it decides for itself what leaves the machine
  ([0110](../../../docs/adr/0110-security-operations.md)).

## Procedure

### 1. Establish the candidate

Fix these before gathering anything, from the arguments, the calling skill's context, or by asking:

| Field | Note |
| --- | --- |
| ecosystem | `npm` / `github-actions` / `container-image` — selects the reference file. A `mise` pin routes to its backend's ecosystem |
| name + candidate version | The exact thing under consideration (tag, version, digest) |
| baseline version | What the caller keeps if this is declined; the diff's other end |
| window `N` and how it was caught | Which disposition fired, and when the candidate ages out |
| urgency | Is a CVE forcing the move, or is this a routine bump? **This does not change the score** — it changes what the recommendation is worth to the reader |

If the baseline cannot be determined (a first-ever pin), say so — **axis D loses its other end** and
is `?` unless the ecosystem offers another comparison.

### 2. Read the matching reference

Read only the one that applies. Each gives the commands per axis and states which axes that ecosystem
cannot answer.

- [`references/npm.md`](references/npm.md) — packages from the npm registry, whether they arrive
  through `package.json`, a Dependabot PR, or a `mise` pin on the `npm:` backend
- [`references/github-actions.md`](references/github-actions.md) — `uses:` references. The richest
  evidence here, because a real commit range is available
- [`references/container-images.md`](references/container-images.md) — image digests. The thinnest

Also read [0110](../../../docs/adr/0110-security-operations.md) for the window that applies —
what the toolchain already guarantees decides whether an axis is free or absent.

### 3. Gather, score, band

Work axis by axis, recording the command and what it showed. Then score, apply both override rules,
and derive the band. **Resist scoring before all four axes are attempted** — a `3` on D found early
tempts you to skip P, and **the publisher answer is what tells the maintainer whether to report the
account upstream.**

### 4. Report in Japanese and stop

Print the report below, then hand back to the calling skill (which runs its own confirmation) or end.
**Make the no-op explicit** — the reader must not have to wonder whether a file moved.

```text
供給網トリアージ: <ecosystem>:<name> <baseline> → <candidate>
  捕捉理由: <disposition>（窓 <N> 日 / 公開 <publish-date>, <age> 日 / 解除 <clear-date>）

  A 出所の一致 : <0-3|?>  <同>
  D 変更内容   : <0-3|?>  <同>
  S 依存/権限面: <0-3|?>  <同>
  <override が効いた場合はその旨: 「D=3 のため HIGH で下限」「? が 2 つのため INSUFFICIENT-EVIDENCE」>

暴露面: <CI 資格情報 / 実行時 / ビルド時のみ>（スコアとは別軸）

  - <検出した具体物、または「該当署名なし」>

推奨: <下記の対応表に従う>

本スキルは何も変更していません（報告のみ）。採用の判断は <呼び出し元 / 利用者> が行います。
```

Map the band to a recommendation:

| Band | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| LOW | 4 つの問いは直接証拠で答えられており、窓の趣旨は満たされている。採用の可否は判断者に委ねる |
| MEDIUM | 既定は窓を待つこと。急ぐ理由があるなら、未解決の点を明示したうえで判断者が決める |
| HIGH / CRITICAL | 採用しない。上流への報告と、当該バージョンを避ける代替（1 つ前の aged 版）を検討する |
| INSUFFICIENT-EVIDENCE | 証拠が取れていないため窓がそのまま効く。待つ |

Restate the walls whenever they apply — **a LOW score does not make a blocked install possible**:

- **`pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s release-age window** is enforced by the resolver, and the block extends to
  a frozen-lockfile replay — so it reaches CI and every other checkout, not only the machine doing
  the resolve. A per-version exemption exists, which makes adopt-or-wait a real choice: **report the
  score as the input to it and leave the decision with the caller.** Never suggest lowering the
  window or turning off its strict mode.
- **`make tools-cooldown-check` fails the build.** A blocked pin is blocked by a check this
  repository owns, and a LOW score does not clear it. The escape hatch is the exemption comment
  [0110](../../../docs/adr/0110-security-operations.md) requires — **a triage verdict is the
  evidence that belongs in that comment's reason, not permission to write it.**
- **A first-ever pin has no aged fallback**, so a LOW score still leaves the choice between waiting
  and a deliberate bootstrap.

## Notes

- **A clean report is a real result.** Most quarantined versions are ordinary releases that happened
  to be recent. Saying so with citations is what lets a team act on a CVE inside the window instead
  of guessing.
- **`?` is not failure.** The ecosystems differ in what they can prove, **by construction** — that
  asymmetry is recorded in [0110](../../../docs/adr/0110-security-operations.md), not a gap in this
  skill. Reporting it honestly is what keeps the score meaningful.
- **A transparency log proves immutability, not benignity.** A publish attestation tells you the
  artifact was not swapped after publication. **A maliciously published version is faithfully,
  verifiably malicious.** Axis A answers a narrower question than it first appears to.
- **Score the move, not the package's reputation.** A widely-used package with a compromised release
  is the normal case for this skill; download counts and stars are not evidence about this version.
- **Attribution matters as much as the verdict.** When a score lands HIGH or CRITICAL, the publisher
  and commit identified on axes P and A are what makes an upstream report actionable. Include them.
- **This repository is public.** When a finding names a live indicator, describe it rather than
  reproducing it, and raise a confirmed compromise privately before it reaches an issue body.
- The skill never commits, stages, or pushes.
