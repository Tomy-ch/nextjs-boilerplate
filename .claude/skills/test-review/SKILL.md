description: >-
  Independent quality review of this repository's test files, run by adversarial subagents on a model that is
  not the implementer's, with each finding re-derived by an independent skeptic. Use it whenever tests should
  be judged rather than run: after tests are written for a new symbol or screen, when coverage is green but
  the viewpoints look thin, and on 「テストをレビューして」「テストの観点が足りているか見て」「このテストは意味があるか」. It hardcodes no rules — ADR
  0090 / 0091, the nearest README's `test-requirement`, and the subject source are read at runtime. Sole owner
  of the test subject, invoked in its own right beside `/impl-review` (the change) and `/comment-sweep` (the
  comment stock), never from inside them. Do NOT use it to review implementation code (`impl-review`) or to
  run the tests (`make test-full`).

# Test Review

Adversarial, low-bias review of this repository's test files. It surfaces what looks broken,
under-tested, or vacuously asserted — and then, with one confirmation, closes the semantic gaps it
found rather than leaving them as a report.

A Japanese reference translation of this skill is available at `SKILL.ja.md` in the same directory
(not loaded as a skill; for human reference only).

## When to Use

- Before commit / PR, on the test files in the current change.
- **When coverage sits at 100 % but regressions still ship.** Under this repository's 100 % coverage
  gate (`make test-full`) coverage carries no information about the assertions — the blind spot Lens
  4 Axis B exists for.
- As a standalone audit of a kernel or a component directory.

## Do NOT use this skill for

- **Reviewing implementation code** — that is `impl-review`.
- **Running the tests** — `make test-full` does that. This skill reads tests; it never executes them.
- **Writing tests for a symbol that has none** — that is `scaffold-test`. Step 5 closes gaps in
  tests that already exist; it does not author a subject's first test.

## What this skill reads

The rule sources are the ADRs, `docs/testing-conventions.md`, and the kernel READMEs, read at runtime:

| Source | What it decides |
| --- | --- |
| [testing-conventions](../../../docs/testing-conventions.md) | Semantic coverage over line coverage, assertion strength, the Testing Library principles for component / hook targets, the mock boundary, what goes where |
| [ADR 0090](../../../docs/adr/0090-testing-strategy.md) | Framework split (Vitest / RTL / MSW / Playwright), export-name `describe`, `正常系` / `異常系` comment separators, per-case naming, one-test-per-subject, skip / todo discipline, per-layer responsibilities, integration = HTTP boundary only |
| [ADR 0091](../../../docs/adr/0091-test-verification-methods.md) | Where async RSC tests live, how a11y automated checks are integrated |
| The kernel `README.md` frontmatter (`test-requirement: unit \| component \| integration \| route \| feature`) | Which test layer the target belongs to |
| [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) | `describe` / `it` strings are Japanese |
| Sibling test files in the same directory | Established local patterns (fixture style, helper signatures, MSW wiring) |
| The subject source file | Required by the two code-origin lenses |

**Do not carry over a testing convention from another language's culture.** A rule that exists to
work around a different runner does not apply here: Vitest runs files in parallel by default (so
there is no per-test opt-in to demand), it has a single `expect` (so there is no fatal / non-fatal
assertion split to enforce), and the mock boundary is MSW rather than generated stub types.

**Where the rule sources are silent, say so rather than inventing a rule.** `docs/testing-conventions.md`
carries the semantic-quality standard, so Lens 3 applies *it* rather than a general principle — but
where it does not reach, report the gap in 補遺 instead of smuggling in a rule as if it were repository
policy (`docs/rules.md`, *作業とエージェント*: do not introduce conventions on your own where nothing derives them).

## Writes

The Japanese report, always. Plus — after one confirmation in Step 5 — the test files the
semantic findings point at. The reviewer subagents stay read-only; the orchestrator does the writes.

## Step 0. Resolve Scope

Stamp the boundary this run crosses before anything else: `.agents/closed-loop/marks.sh reviewStartedAt`.

`AskUserQuestion`:

- Question: 「test-review の対象スコープを指定してください」
- Options:
  - 「変更ファイル (HEAD-vs-working tree, 推奨)」 — `git diff --name-only` から `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` を抽出。新規追加 (`--diff-filter=A`) も含める
  - 「ブランチ base 比較」 — base は `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`、PR が無ければ `make -s base-branch` で解く（`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef` は使わない）。その base との `git merge-base` 以降に touch されたテスト
  - 「レビュー指摘への対応分」 — 前回レビューの最終コミット `...HEAD`。反映そのものが未レビューである（`AGENTS.md` の Review Phase Protocol）
  - 「特定パス / ディレクトリ (free-text)」
  - 「キャンセル」

If no test files are in scope, stop — there is nothing to review. The one case that keeps running is
a scope of **production files with no paired test**: an untested subject is precisely Lens 5's
subject, and Lenses 1–3 simply have nothing to read for it (skip them for that file rather than
returning an empty result that reads as a pass).

For each target test file, resolve its **subject source file** — the same directory, the basename
without `.test`. Required by Lenses 4 and 5.

## Step 1. Read Layer Context

For every target:

1. Walk up from the file to the nearest kernel `README.md` and read its `test-requirement`
   frontmatter and body.
2. Read ADR 0090 and ADR 0091 once per run.
3. Read the subject source file.
4. Read sibling test files in the same directory.

`test-requirement` is what ADR 0090's per-layer table keys off. A `unit` kernel and a `component`
kernel are not held to the same viewpoints, and a target whose kernel declares `integration` is
bound by "HTTP 境界のみ / 内側は mock / 型・形状をアサート".

## Step 2. Fan Out Five Adversarial Reviewers

Spawn five `adversarial-reviewer` subagents **in parallel**, each on `sonnet` by default so the
reviewer differs from an Opus implementer. Each gets the same Step 1 bundle and a different lens.

Two are **code-origin** — they start from the subject source, so code with no test at all still
enters their field of view. That is the blind spot a test-file-first read structurally cannot see.

### Lens 1: Structural Compliance

Mechanical adherence to ADR 0090 — read it this run and apply what it currently says. The rules
live in its 「テストの構成: export ↔ describe の 1:1 対応」 section (the export-name `describe`, comment
separators rather than nested `describe`s, the 軸の選び方 that decides whether a subject splits on
`正常系` / `異常系` or on display state, which side a case sits on, per-case naming, skip / todo
discipline), 「mock 戦略」 (the MSW boundary), 「配置・命名」 (co-location) and the 「禁止事項」 list;
`AGENTS.md` Language Rules make the case names Japanese. This lens carries no copy of those rules:
each finding cites the section it violates, and where the ADR is silent the gap goes to 補遺.

**Do not re-report what the gate already fails on.** `scripts/one-to-one.gate.test.ts` mechanically
catches the four name-level shapes — `missing-test-file`, `missing-describe`, `duplicate-describe`,
`unknown-describe` (a top-level `正常系` bundle lands here). Those are already red in CI, so state them
in one line at most and spend this lens on what the gate cannot read: separator grouping, which side a
case sits on, case-name quality, per-case naming, skip / todo discipline, the MSW boundary, and co-location.
**A subject with no test at all belongs to Lens 5** — this lens judges only the shape of the tests that
exist, so the two never double-report.

Output: findings with `file:line` and the violated rule.

### Lens 2: Viewpoint Coverage

Compares what the layer owes to what the test actually exercises.

- The kernel's `test-requirement` selects the row of ADR 0090's per-layer table; check the test
  against that row's duty (unit = pure logic, component = 描画・振る舞い, integration = HTTP 境界の
  型・形状, route / feature per the ADR).
- For component tests, ADR 0091 makes the a11y automated check part of the duty — a component test
  with no `axe` assertion is a viewpoint gap.
- `components/README.md` states which UI owns which states: a component that owns
  loading / empty / error / success must exercise them; one that does not own them must not have
  meaningless state cases invented for it. Read it for component targets.

**The viewpoints come from the kernel README's `test-requirement` frontmatter.** When a target's
viewpoints cannot be derived from the ADRs plus the frontmatter, report that as a documentation gap
in 補遺 rather than silently returning nothing, which would read as a pass.

**When the declaration and the tests disagree, adjudicate by these rules** rather than case by case, so
the same situation is not decided two different ways in two directories. State which rule you applied.

- **The tests are sound design → amend the declaration.** When the approach the tests take is
  architecturally justified, it is the declaration that failed to describe reality. Propose fixing the
  README — normally by giving the directory its own `test-requirement` — and propose **the criterion
  that selects the approach**, not just the approach, so the next directory in the same situation
  applies a rule instead of copying a precedent.
- **The declaration is the correct intent → amend the tests.** When the deviation has no design
  justification, the frontmatter states what should be true; bring the tests in line with it.
- **An inherited declaration governs only where its premises hold.** The nearest ancestor's
  `test-requirement` applies to a subdirectory only when its preconditions actually hold there — an
  `integration` declaration written for an HTTP-boundary adapter does not govern a sibling of pure
  formatting helpers. Resolving *formally* by the walk is not the same as the declaration applying:
  treat an inapplicable nearest declaration exactly like a missing one, as a documentation gap closed
  by giving that directory its own frontmatter.
- **A directory that is not a kernel still owns its viewpoints.** `scripts/` / `tokens/` /
  `docs-viewer/` have no kernel README above them by construction. Their viewpoints belong in their own
  README, and their absence is a gap to report — not a licence to review them against nothing.

Which side an adjudication took, and why, belongs in the PR that makes the change — not in the README
and not in this report beyond the one-line rule name.

Output: viewpoints the layer owes that the test does not exercise.

### Lens 3: Semantic Quality

Whether the assertions mean anything. **`docs/testing-conventions.md` is the standard** — read it this
run and apply what it currently says: 「アサーションの強さ」 for what a weak or vacuous assertion is,
「component / hook のテスト — Testing Library の原則」 for component / hook targets (cite the document
and the principle by name in the finding), 「mock の境界」 for over-mocking. This lens carries no copy of
those rules; where the document is silent, flag the gap in 補遺 rather than inventing one.

Output: findings with `file:line` and a one-sentence reason the assertion is weak.

### Lens 4: Branch × Meaning Completeness (code-origin)

Reads the subject source and builds, per function, a two-axis matrix. **Coverage ≠ meaning**
(`docs/testing-conventions.md` 「意味網羅 — カバレッジは情報を持たない」 is the standard; the matrix is
how this lens applies it), and in a repository with a 100 % gate that distinction is the only one left
that carries information.

**Division from Lens 5**: Lens 4 audits *within* a symbol that already has a test. "No test at all"
is Lens 5's finding — when Lens 5 flags a symbol, do not also enumerate its branches here (that is
one gap, not N).

**Axis A — 分岐網羅**: every logical branch is reached by at least one case. Every conditional, every
thrown error kind, every boundary pair, every guard against nil / empty input. A branch reached only
by a harness that never executes the body is not covered.

A branch with no covering case is **分岐未カバー** → severity **追加検討**. Cite the subject
`file:line` and propose an `it` name. Attach a **criticality (1-10)** scored by production impact —
orthogonal to severity, which says what *kind* of gap it is — plus one line on the regression that
would ship: 9-10 データ破壊 / 認証・認可の穴 · 7-8 ユーザ影響のあるロジック誤り · 5-6 軽微な edge ·
3-4 網羅性のための nice-to-have · 1-2 任意. Order 追加検討 by criticality descending. Do not attach
criticality to 修正必須 findings — those are fix-now regardless.

**Axis B — 意味網羅**: each covered branch's case asserts that branch's *distinctive* outcome.

- An error branch asserts which error, not merely that it threw.
- A success branch asserts the resulting value or DOM state that distinguishes it from the others.
- A state-changing handler asserts the post-change state, not just that it was called.
- A boundary case asserts the differing outcome on both sides.

A branch that is covered but not distinctly asserted is **分岐カバー済み・意味未検証** → severity
**再考**. Tie it to the specific branch and the case that nominally covers it.

### Lens 5: Subject Symbol Completeness (code-origin)

Starts from the subject source at *symbol* granularity, answering "does a test exist for this at
all?" A test-file-first read can only judge the tests it finds; a symbol with zero tests is
invisible to it.

1. Build the exported-symbol table from the paired subject (exported functions, components, hooks,
   and unexported module-level functions carrying branching logic). Generated files and test-only
   helpers are out of scope.
2. Match each symbol to a test.
3. Flag every unmatched symbol as **シンボル未カバー** → severity **補完推奨**, citing
   `symbol @ file:line`, proposing the `describe` name (the symbol's own name) with its
   `// ----- 正常系 -----` / `// ----- 異常系 -----` skeleton of `it` calls, and attaching the same
   criticality score. Order by criticality descending.

## Step 3. Verify Each Finding

Each surviving finding goes to an independent `review-verifier` subagent on `sonnet`. It re-derives
the conclusion from the code rather than trusting the finder, and **defaults to skepticism** —
label PLAUSIBLE or REFUTED when ambiguity remains.

Verification runs in parallel across findings. REFUTED findings are dropped from the report, with
the count mentioned so the user knows the noise floor. CONFIRMED and PLAUSIBLE are kept.

## Step 4. Synthesize the Report

One Japanese report:

```text
# Test Review レポート

対象: <スコープ + ファイル一覧>
レンズ: 構造準拠 / 観点カバレッジ / 意味的品質 / 分岐×意味 / シンボル網羅
verifier 通過: CONFIRMED <n> 件 / PLAUSIBLE <m> 件 / REFUTED <k> 件（除外済み）

## サマリ
- 修正必須 / 補完推奨 / 再考 / 追加検討: 各 <件数>

## 構造準拠（修正必須）
- [<severity>] <file>:<line> — <違反した規則>
  - 出典: ADR 0090 の該当節
  - verifier: CONFIRMED / PLAUSIBLE

## 観点カバレッジ（補完推奨）
## 意味的品質（再考）
## シンボル網羅（補完推奨）  ← criticality 降順
## 分岐網羅（追加検討）      ← criticality 降順
## 意味網羅（再考）

## 補遺
- <ADR / README / testing-conventions.md の補完候補>
```

Severity mapping:

- **修正必須** — Lens 1. ADR 0090 の規則違反。CONFIRMED → 修正必須 / PLAUSIBLE → 確認推奨
- **補完推奨** — Lens 2 と Lens 5。層が負う観点が未実施、またはシンボルにテストが 1 つも無い
- **再考** — Lens 3 と Lens 4 Axis B。通るが何も明らかにしない
- **追加検討** — Lens 4 Axis A。subject 起点で見つけた未カバー分岐

## Step 5. Close the Semantic Gaps (default; skip on the user's word)

**A reported gap that nobody closes gets reproduced.** This repository's tests are written by AI, so
the same missing assertion reappears the next time the same shape of code is written. Reporting is
therefore not the end state for the findings that describe a *missing or vacuous assertion*.

In scope for this step:

- **再考** — Lens 3 (weak / vacuous assertions) and Lens 4 Axis B (covered but not distinctly asserted)
- **追加検討** — Lens 4 Axis A (a branch with no covering case)

Out of scope — report only:

- **修正必須** (Lens 1) — a structural rule violation is a rewrite of existing cases, and which way to
  resolve it can depend on an ADR amendment (Lens 2's adjudication rules). Leave it to the user.
- **補完推奨** (Lens 2 / Lens 5) — a symbol with no test at all is `scaffold-test`'s job, and a missing
  layer viewpoint may be a declaration bug rather than a test bug.

Confirm once before editing:

- `AskUserQuestion`: 「意味網羅の穴 <N> 件にテストを追加しますか？」 — options: 「すべて追加」 /
  「1 件ずつ確認」 / 「追加しない（レポートのみ）」.

Then, per finding:

1. Add the case under the subject's existing `describe`, on the side the outcome puts it
   (ADR 0090), with a Japanese `it` name.
2. **Prove the case earns its place.** Break the branch it covers — invert the condition, drop the
   guard — confirm the new case fails, then restore. A case that passes against the broken
   implementation verifies nothing and must not be kept. Report what you broke and that it failed.
3. Never weaken an existing case to make room, and never delete one.

After editing, verify: `pnpm fix`, `pnpm lint:ci`, and the target's own test run. Do NOT commit —
leave the changes for the user (or a later `/commit`).

Skip the step when the user declines, and say so in the report rather than leaving it silent.

## Step 6. Next Action

End with one concrete suggestion covering what Step 5 did **not** close — the 修正必須 and 補完推奨
findings. Name the files and the specific cases, and point a symbol with no test at all at
`scaffold-test`. If nothing survives verification, say so (「verifier 通過後 0 件です」).

## Relationship to the other review skills

This skill owns the **tests**, and it owns them alone: no other review skill carries a test lens, and
this one is invoked in its own right rather than from inside another. `/impl-review` (the change) and
`/comment-sweep` (the comment stock) are its peers under the Review Phase Protocol in `AGENTS.md` —
asked for separately, decided separately, and never delegating to one another.

Lens 5 owns "no test at all" and Lens 4 owns branch × meaning, so both shapes have exactly one
reporter. This skill never chains onward.

## Constraints

- ❌ Editing anything outside Step 5's scope. Reporting is read-only; only the semantic gaps are
  closed, only after the confirmation, and only in test files.
- ❌ Running the tests (`make test-full` is a separate, heavier gate — `repo-ops` §7).
- ❌ Trusting finder output without verification, unless the caller passed `skip_verifier: true`.
- ❌ Hardcoding the rule list — ADR 0090 / 0091 and the kernel READMEs are read at runtime.
- ❌ Importing a convention that exists to work around a different runner (a per-test parallel
  opt-in, a fatal / non-fatal assertion split, generated stub-type mocks).
- ❌ Inventing a convention where the rule sources are silent — report the gap instead.
- ✅ Skepticism by default in the verifier.
- ✅ Reviewer model defaults to `sonnet`; the orchestrator may override to keep reviewer ≠ implementer.
- ✅ criticality (1-10) は Lens 4 Axis A と Lens 5 の finding に付す本番影響のソート鍵で、レンズ由来の severity を置換しない。
- ✅ 「テストが 1 つも無いシンボル」は Lens 5 の所管。Lens 1 の逆方向確認や Lens 4 と二重報告しない。
- ✅ Step 5 で足した各ケースは、対象の分岐を壊すと落ちることを確かめてから残す。
