name: adr-scan
description: PROVISIONAL / one-off. Read-only full-repository scan that discovers ADR-worthy architectural decisions across the whole repo and maps each to the BACKLOG frame-ID taxonomy (Tier 0–6 / G,T,R,A,B,C,D). Unlike the go-boilerplate original (which migrated a flat decisions.md into docs/adr/), this repo already has a formal docs/adr/ set + BACKLOG.md board — so the job here is DISCOVERY of decisions that exist de-facto (in AGENTS.md, config files, src/ structure, .github/, code comments) but are NOT yet tracked as a BACKLOG frame, classifying each as decision (frame-worthy) / exclusion (frame-worthy negative decision) / rule (stays in AGENTS.md) / inventory (living reference), and proposing which Tier / frame ID it belongs to (existing or new). Read-only: produces a candidate inventory only; writes no docs/adr files and does not edit BACKLOG.md. Delete or archive once the discovered gaps are folded into BACKLOG.md.

# adr-scan (provisional)

**Status: temporary / one-off.** Built to sweep the repo for architectural decisions that are *real but
untracked* — deciding whether each deserves a slot on `docs/adr/BACKLOG.md`. Read-only: it emits a
**candidate inventory** only. It never writes `docs/adr/**`, never edits `BACKLOG.md`, never edits
source. Remove or archive it once the discovered gaps have been reconciled into the BACKLOG.

## Why this exists here (differs from the go-boilerplate original)

The go-boilerplate version migrated a flat `docs/decisions.md` into a formal `docs/adr/` set. **This <!-- skill-lint-ignore -->
repo is already past that**: it has a formal ADR set (`docs/adr/0001-*` … `0155-*`, numbered in topical decade-bands)
and a live board (`docs/adr/BACKLOG.md`) that tracks every decision area across Tiers 0–6 with
frame IDs (`G` / `T` / `R` / `A` / `B` / `C` / `D`) and a 選定済み / 実装済み status pair.

So the useful job here is **gap discovery**: find decisions that are being made *de facto* — encoded in
`AGENTS.md`, config files, the `src/` layout, `.github/`, or code comments — but are **not represented
by any BACKLOG frame** (or are represented but mis-tiered / mis-classified). The output feeds the
BACKLOG運用ルール flow: *新しい意思決定領域に気付いたら該当 Tier への追加 → 内容合意 → ADR 化*.

## Classification taxonomy (the core judgment)

Each candidate is exactly one of:

- **decision** — a choice among alternatives with lasting consequences (X over Y). BACKLOG-frame-worthy.
- **exclusion** — a deliberate "we intentionally do NOT do X" with rationale. Frame-worthy (negative
  decision; the BACKLOG "明示的に boilerplate では決めない (out of scope)" section is the home for some
  of these).
- **rule** — a day-to-day constraint/consequence (e.g. "use the `@/*` alias", "commit prefixes"). Stays
  in `AGENTS.md`; may *reference* an ADR but is not itself a new decision area.
- **inventory** — a catalog that drifts with code (dependency list, script list). Stays in a living
  reference doc / README, never an ADR.

A candidate is frame-worthy only if: it has (or implies) considered alternatives, it is cross-cutting or
hard to reverse, and it is not merely restating an existing rule/inventory or an already-tracked frame.

## Scan surfaces (fan out one read-only worker each)

Fan these out in parallel via the Agent tool (read-only); each returns candidates in the output shape
below. Then the orchestrator dedups against the existing BACKLOG frames.

1. **Existing ADR + board** — `docs/adr/*.md` + `docs/adr/BACKLOG.md`. Build the baseline set of
   *already-tracked* frames (so discoveries can be diffed against it). Note any ADR whose Status or
   BACKLOG status pair looks inconsistent with reality.
2. **AGENTS.md** — the `## [TODO]` sections (each is a pending area — confirm it maps to a BACKLOG
   frame), the "AI Modification Scope" / "Protected Documentation" / "Git Rules" / "Language Rules"
   sections. Separate genuine decisions from rules.
3. **Config & tooling (latent decisions)** — `package.json` (deps, scripts, `packageManager`),
   `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `biome.json`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `mise.toml`, `.makefiles/**`,
   `.github/**`. A pinned tool, an enabled compiler flag, a CI job, a `browserslist` — each may be a
   decision made in config but never elevated to an ADR/frame.
4. **`src/` de-facto structure** — the actual directory layout, `"use client"` placement, route
   conventions, styling approach (Tailwind usage), any state/data-fetch pattern. These are the A-tier /
   B-tier de-facto states; check each is reflected (as ⚠️ de-facto) in BACKLOG and not silently
   hardening into an unrecorded convention.
5. **Latent in prose/comments** — `README*`, code `// TODO` / `// why` comments, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
   Decisions or exclusions stated in passing but never tracked.

## Output (per candidate)

```text
- title:         short decision title (imperative, ADR-style)
  type:          decision | exclusion | rule | inventory
  frame_worthy:  yes | no
  source:        file:line (evidence)
  alternatives:  present | implied | none
  backlog_state: tracked <frameID> | untracked | mis-tiered <current→proposed> | mis-classified
  proposed_tier: Tier N + letter (e.g. "Tier 4 / B") — existing frame ID if one fits, else "new"
  note:          one line — why worthy / why not / what's inconsistent
```

Aggregate into:

- **(A) Untracked decisions/exclusions** — frame-worthy but absent from BACKLOG, with a proposed Tier +
  frame ID. *This is the primary deliverable.*
- **(B) Tracked-but-drifted** — frames whose BACKLOG status pair (選定済み / 実装済み) or Tier looks wrong
  vs the observed reality.
- **(C) Stays-a-rule list** — belongs in AGENTS.md, not a new frame.
- **(D) Stays-inventory list** — belongs in a living reference, never an ADR.

The orchestrator presents these to the user as *candidates only*. Folding any of them into
`BACKLOG.md` (or filing an ADR) is a **separate, user-approved step** — this skill does not perform it
(BACKLOG.md is AI-editable per CLAUDE.md, but the 運用ルール requires 内容合意 before a frame is added).

## Constraints

- ✅ Read-only. Emit a candidate inventory only. Never write `docs/adr/**`, never edit `BACKLOG.md` or
  source, never file an ADR.
- ✅ Respect the Instruction Priority: AGENTS.md > ADRs > BACKLOG > agent configs. A "decision" that
  contradicts an Accepted ADR is a finding, not something to normalize.
- ✅ Provisional: delete or archive this skill once the discovered gaps are reconciled into BACKLOG.md.
- ❌ Do not invent decisions to fill perceived gaps — only surface what has real evidence (file:line).
