name: submit-pr
description: Push the current feature branch to `origin` and create or update its GitHub pull request. Detects whether a PR already exists for the current branch via `gh pr view` and automatically chooses between "create" and "update", then merges the up-to-date base branch into the current branch before anything is reviewed or pushed, so the local review and CI both judge the state that will actually land. The PR body is filled from `.github/pull_request_template.md` (sections `概要` / `変更内容` / `動作確認方法`) using the commit history and diff. Title and body are written in Japanese per `CLAUDE.md`. The skill confirms with the user before any push, with the exact wording required by `CLAUDE.md` for the update path.

# Submit PR

This skill pushes the current branch to `origin` and ensures a GitHub pull request exists for it. It handles two cases automatically:

- **Create**: no PR exists for the current branch → push (with `-u` if no upstream) and open a new PR.
- **Update**: an open PR already exists → confirm with the user, then push (the PR's diff auto-updates).

Before either, it brings the base branch into the current branch so that what gets reviewed and pushed is the state that will actually land.

The PR body is filled from `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The skill never auto-pushes, never overwrites an existing PR's title/body, and never force-pushes.

A Japanese reference translation of this skill is available at `SKILL.ja.md` in the same directory (not loaded as a skill; for human reference only).

## Preconditions

- `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated (`gh auth status` succeeds).
- Current branch is not a protected branch (`production` / `develop` / `staging` / `release/*`).
- Working tree is clean. If there are uncommitted changes, the skill aborts and suggests running `/commit` first.

## Step 0. Pre-flight Checks

Run in parallel:

```sh
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD                          # current branch
git status --porcelain                                   # working-tree state
git rev-parse --verify '@{u}' 2>/dev/null                # upstream existence
git log '@{u}'..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null               # unpushed commits (if upstream)
gh auth status
```

Bail out if any of the following:

- Branch matches `^(production|develop|staging|release/.+|hotfix/.+)$` → tell the user to switch to a feature branch.
- `git status --porcelain` is non-empty → tell the user to run `/commit` (or stash) first.
- `gh auth status` fails → tell the user to run `gh auth login`.

These checks come first because the later steps depend on them: a merge cannot run against a dirty tree, and nothing should operate on a protected branch.

The four valid working states going into Step 1:

| Upstream | Unpushed commits | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none | n/a | First push case |
| set | > 0 | Subsequent push case |
| set | 0 | Nothing to push; PR may still need to be created |
| set | 0 + PR open | Nothing to do (decided at the end of Step 2, because the merge can change the count) |

## Step 1. Detect Existing PR and Base Branch

```sh
gh pr view --json number,state,baseRefName,headRefName,url,title,body 2>/dev/null
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q '.defaultBranchRef.name'
```

Branch on the result:

- **PR exists and state is `OPEN`** → "update" path. Base branch is fixed (`baseRefName` from the result).
- **PR exists but state is `MERGED` / `CLOSED`** → ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:
  - Question: 「このブランチには `<state>` 状態の PR #N があります。新規 PR を作成しますか？」
  - Options: 「新規 PR を作成する」 / 「キャンセル」
- **No PR exists** → "create" path. Base branch defaults to the repo's default branch.

For the "create" path, if multiple `release/*` branches exist locally and the user may want a non-default target, confirm via `AskUserQuestion`:

- Question: 「ベースブランチをこれで作成しますか？」
- Options: 「`<default-branch>` を使う」 / 「別のブランチを指定する」

The base branch has to be decided here because the next step merges it.

## Step 2. Sync with the Base Branch

Bring `<base>` — the branch decided in Step 1 — into the current branch, so the review, the pre-push hook, and CI all judge the state that will actually land.

```sh
git fetch origin --prune
git merge origin/<base> --no-edit
```

**Never check out or push the base branch.** `release/**` and the other protected branches are push-forbidden by `CLAUDE.md`; merging `origin/<base>` updates the current branch only, which is all this step needs. `git fetch` is what "updating the base" means here — it refreshes the remote-tracking ref.

Handle the outcomes:

- **Already up to date** → say so and continue. Do not create an empty commit.
- **Merge succeeded** → report how many commits came in. The resulting merge commit is part of what gets pushed at Step 7, so re-read the unpushed commit count after this step rather than reusing Step 0's.
- **Conflict** → **stop here and hand it to the user.** Never resolve conflicts automatically. Print the conflicting paths and:

  > ベースの取り込みでコンフリクトしました。解消して `/commit` で確定してから、改めて `/submit-pr` を実行してください。（`git merge --abort` で取り込み前に戻せます。）

Now apply the early exits that depend on the post-merge commit count:

- "update" path with 0 unpushed commits → tell the user there is nothing to push and stop. Print the existing PR URL.
- "create" path with 0 unpushed commits but the remote branch exists → continue (we will create a PR for whatever is already on the remote).

## Step 3. Pre-push Local Review Gate (confirm)

With the base merged in and **before composing anything or pushing**, ask whether to run a pre-push `/impl-review`. This is the single decision point for local review: it inspects the local diff on a different model than the implementer and catches gaps that mocked tests miss, and it belongs before the change leaves the machine. Do NOT auto-run it.

Placing it after Step 2 is deliberate — reviewing the pre-merge state would judge a tree that never reaches CI.

`AskUserQuestion`:

- Question: 「push 前に `/impl-review`（実装者とは別モデルの独立・敵対レビュー）を実行しますか？」
- Options:
  - 「`/impl-review` を実行する（submit-pr はキャンセル）」 — cancel-and-guide, see below.
  - 「実行済み / 不要（このまま進める）」 — continue to Step 4.
  - 「キャンセル」 — abort.

**On the review choice, cancel submit-pr and guide the user to review — do NOT chain `/impl-review` inline and do NOT try to resume this run.** Print:

> submit-pr をキャンセルします。`/impl-review` を実行し、指摘を修正してから `/commit` で確定し、改めて `/submit-pr` を実行してください。（clean tree でないと push できないため、レビュー修正の commit を先に済ませる必要があります。次回はこの Step 3 で「実行済み」を選べばそのまま進みます。ベースの取り込みは済んでいるので、次回の Step 2 は「Already up to date」で通ります。）

Why a clean cancel rather than a pause-and-resume: a local review commonly produces fixes, which must be committed *before* submit-pr can run at all (the clean-tree precondition in Step 0, and the push in Step 7). Since the working tree will change anyway, there is nothing to "resume" — the next `/submit-pr` is a fresh, cheap run that flows straight through once the fixes are committed.

**Depth by change type** — scale the recommendation to what the diff touches (this same scaling also drives the post-PR review at the final step):

- **Behavior-affecting code** (`src/**` の `.ts` / `.tsx`、Server Action、Route Handler、`adapters`) → recommend the review by default.
- **Docs / tooling-dominant changes** (`docs/**`、`*.md`、`.claude/**`、`AGENTS.md`、CI 設定 — 本番の振る舞いを変えない) → note the lower ROI so the user can decline quickly; still ask.

Judge the dominant nature of the diff (changed paths / commit prefixes) for the default recommendation, but the user's choice always wins.

## Step 4. Gather Context and Read Template

Collect the inputs needed to compose title and body. `<base>` is the base branch decided in Step 1.

```sh
git log <base>..HEAD --pretty=format:'%h %s'                # commit titles
git log <base>..HEAD --pretty=format:'%h%n%s%n%b%n---'      # commit titles + bodies
git diff <base>...HEAD --shortstat                          # diff summary
git diff <base>...HEAD --name-only                          # changed files
```

Read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and identify sections by `#` / `##` headers. The current template defines:

- `# 概要`
- `## 変更内容`
- `## 動作確認方法`

Strip the HTML comment placeholders. If the template is absent, fall back to the same three-section structure inline.

## Step 5. Compose Title and Body

### Title

- Derive from the most significant change. Single-commit PR → use that commit's title (strip the leading `<Prefix>:` only if redundant). Multi-commit PR → summarize the overall intent in Japanese.
- ≤ 70 characters.
- If the branch name embeds an issue number (`feature/1234-...`, `bugfix/5678-...`), include `#1234` in the title naturally.
- For the "update" path: keep the existing PR title unchanged unless the user explicitly asks to change it.

### Body

Fill each template section in Japanese:

- **概要**: 1–3 sentences summarizing the PR's intent. Use commit messages as the primary source.
- **変更内容**: Bullet list grouped by area (API / DB / 内部ロジック / テスト / ドキュメント など). Reference changed files and commit titles. Group meaningfully — do not paste a raw file list. A merge commit produced by Step 2 is not a change of this PR; do not list it.
- **動作確認方法**: Concrete verification steps. Adapt to what actually changed: `pnpm dev` plus the screens to open for UI changes, `pnpm build` when the change can break the production build, `pnpm lint:ci` / `pnpm typecheck` for the rest.

If the branch name encodes an issue number, append `closes #N` at the bottom of the body (or fold it into 概要 if natural).

## Step 6. Confirm with the User

Local review was already decided at Step 3 — do not ask again here.

Display the resolved title, base branch, push command, and full body. If Step 2 merged anything, say so, so the user knows the push includes a merge commit.

### Create path

`AskUserQuestion`:

- Question: 「以下の内容で PR を作成しますか？」
- Options:
  - 「この内容で作成する」
  - 「draft で作成する」
  - 「title / body を修正したい」
  - 「キャンセル」

If the user chooses "修正したい", collect free-text feedback, regenerate the relevant section, and re-confirm.

### Update path

Display the unpushed commit list and diff summary. Then ask with the wording required by `CLAUDE.md`:

- Question: 「変更はローカルにコミット済みです。これらの変更をプルリクエストにプッシュしますか？」
- Options: 「push する」 / 「キャンセル」

## Step 7. Push

```sh
# First push (no upstream)
git push -u origin <branch>

# Subsequent push
git push
```

A branch cut from `origin/release/*` (the merged-PR recovery flow in `commit`) has its upstream pointing at that **protected** base, so a bare `git push` would target the protected branch. Always do the first push with the explicit refspec `git push -u origin <branch>` to repoint the upstream at the feature branch; only after that is a bare `git push` safe.

Never use `--force` or `--force-with-lease` unless the user has explicitly requested it.

On push failure (non-fast-forward, permission denied, network error, etc.), report the error verbatim to the user and stop. Do not attempt automatic recovery.

### The pre-push hook is the verification step — do not pre-empt it

`pre-push` runs the heavy gates (`pnpm typecheck` / `make test-full` / `make secret-scan`) through lefthook. Let the hook make that call.

Do **not** run `pnpm lint:ci` / `make test-full` by hand before pushing to "make sure" — with several windows open that is minutes of saturated host to rediscover what CI runs identically, and the saturation itself makes unrelated gates fail (`repo-ops` §7). **Pushing *is* the verification step.**

**When the hook fails for a reason outside this change** — an uncommitted file another session is mid-edit on, two Vitest runs colliding over the same `coverage/` directory, a tool missing from `PATH` — the failure is not about the change being pushed. `repo-ops` §7 covers the `--no-verify` carve-out and its conditions. Report which gate failed and why it is outside the change, and let the user decide; never take the carve-out silently.

## Step 8. Create or Update the PR

### Create the PR

```sh
gh pr create \
  --base "<base-branch>" \
  --title "<title>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<body>
EOF
)" [--draft]
```

### Update the PR

Step 7's push already updated the PR's diff. Do NOT touch the PR's title or body by default.

Only if the user explicitly asked to update them, run:

```sh
gh pr edit <number> [--title "<new-title>"] [--body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<new-body>
EOF
)"]
```

## Step 9. Report

Print the PR URL and a brief summary in Japanese.

For the create path:

```text
PR を作成しました: <url>
ベース: <base-branch>
タイトル: <title>
コミット数: N
```

For the update path:

```text
PR を更新しました: <url>
追加コミット数: N
```

If Step 2 merged the base in, add one line stating how many commits were taken in.

## Step 10. Post-PR Review (confirm)

After the PR URL is reported, **always ask the user whether to run a review** — do not skip this, and do not auto-run a review. Use `AskUserQuestion`:

- Question: 「PR を作成/更新しました。コードレビューを実行しますか？」
- Options (offer the ones that apply):
  - 「`/impl-review` を実行」 — local diff, different-model adversarial review; it chains `/test-review` (test viewpoints) and `/comment-sweep` (the touched files' comment stock), so one invocation covers all three (strong on auth / IDOR / DI / SQL / shared-schema gaps that mocked tests miss); posts its surviving findings as inline PR comments by default (`--no-comment` to suppress)
  - 「`/code-review <PR#>` を実行」 — PR-based review (can post inline comments with `--comment`)
  - 「ultrareview を案内」 — cloud multi-agent review; **user-triggered and billed**, so the skill cannot launch it — only surface the command for the user to run
  - 「レビューしない」

### Depth by change type

Scale the recommended depth to what changed (if a full source review is 10):

- **Behavior-affecting code** (`src/**` の `.ts` / `.tsx`、Server Action、Route Handler、`adapters`) → full depth (10); recommend a review by default.
- **Docs / tooling-dominant changes** (`docs/**`、`*.md`、`.claude/**`、`AGENTS.md`、CI 設定 — 本番の振る舞いを変えない) → shallower is acceptable (~7–8/10). Still ask, but note the lower ROI so the user can decide quickly.

Judge the dominant nature of the diff (changed file paths / commit prefixes) to pick the default recommendation, but the user's choice always wins.
