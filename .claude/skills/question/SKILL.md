description: >-
  The front door for any question about this repository whose intended reading is not obvious. It answers
  nothing itself: it resolves what the asker meant along three axes — which world, which intent, which subject
  — confirms that reading whenever an axis genuinely splits, and hands the question to whoever owns the
  answer. Use it when a question could be taken more than one way: 「今のこれってどうなの？」 turns on which *now* is
  meant; 「テストどう？」 splits across `test-review` and `repo-truth`; 「これ大丈夫？」 splits across nearly everything. Also
  use it when the asker does not know which skill exists for what. Do NOT use it when the reading is already
  unambiguous — go to the owning skill (`repo-truth` / `repo-ops` / `how-to` / `research`) — and never to
  produce an answer, a procedure, or a review of its own.

# Question

Work out what the asker actually meant, confirm it, and hand the question to whoever owns the answer.

A Japanese reference translation lives at `SKILL.ja.md` in this directory (for human reference only;
not loaded as a skill).

## When to Use

- A question could reasonably be read more than one way.
- The asker does not know which skill covers what, or asks where a question should go.
- A previous run answered the wrong reading and it needs re-routing.

## Contract

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Owns** | 問いの読みの解決（世界 / 意図 / 対象の 3 軸）、人への確認、所有スキルへの引き渡し |
| **Never** | 自分で答える / 手順を組む / 比較する / レビューする / 軸が割れているのに黙って片方を選ぶ |
| **Starts when** | 問いの読み方が一意でないとき、どのスキルが担当か分からないとき |
| **Stops when** | 引き渡し先が決まったとき、または該当するスキルが無いと分かったとき |

## Do NOT use this skill for

- A question whose reading is already unambiguous — go straight to the owner.
- Producing an answer, a procedure, a comparison, or a review of its own.

## Why this exists

Every other door here has a check that redirects a mis-triggered question. That catches the easy
case — the one where the wrong door is *visible* from inside it. It does not catch the case this
skill is for: a question that is genuinely well-formed under two different readings, where each
destination would produce a competent, confident, differently-scoped answer, and **nothing in the
output would reveal that the other reading existed**.

The commonest form is a bare 「今」: it can mean the industry outside this repository, this repository
as it stands, or the diff in this window. Each reading has a different owner, each owner would answer
competently, and nothing in the sentence chooses. A skill that picks one produces an answer that reads
as complete — which is exactly why picking is the wrong move and asking is the right one.

**The ambiguity is in the asker, so the asker resolves it.** That is not a fallback for a weak
heuristic; it is where the information actually lives.

## The three axes

Resolve the question along these. Most questions are unambiguous on all three; the ones that reach
here split on one, occasionally two.

| Axis | Splits into | Signal that it is split |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **World** | 外の世界 / このリポジトリ全体 / この窓の差分 | a bare 「今」「最近」「普通」, or a comparison with no stated baseline |
| **Intent** | 症状 / 目標 / 知識 / 未決の選択 | 「どう」「大丈夫」「どうなってる」 with no verb naming an action or a failure |
| **Subject** | 実装 / テスト / コメント / 文書 / 語彙 / 運用 | a noun that names all of them at once（「品質」「これ」「この画面」） |

The axes are independent, so state each one's reading separately rather than jumping to a skill name.
A reader can correct 「差分ではなくリポジトリ全体の話」 far more easily than 「`impl-review` ではなく
`repo-truth`」, because the first is about their own question and the second is about a tool they may
not know.

## Step 1 — Read the question and resolve what you can

Restate the question in one line, with your reading of each axis. Resolve every axis the sentence
actually settles — most of them.

Do this from the sentence and its context, **not by reading the codebase**. Investigating to
disambiguate is doing the destination's job, and it is also usually futile: no file says which *now*
the asker meant.

Two contextual facts legitimately settle an axis, and both should be stated when used:

- **An open diff.** Unmerged commits on the branch make the *this window* reading live; a clean tree
  makes it nearly impossible. Check, and say what you found. Resolve the base the way `commit` and
  `submit-pr` do — `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`, else `make -s base-branch`.
- **The immediately preceding conversation.** A question following an implementation is usually about
  that change. Say that you inferred it from context so it can be corrected.

## Step 2 — Ask, but only about what is actually split

If every axis resolved, skip to Step 3 and say the reading in one line. **Do not manufacture a modal
for an unambiguous question**; the friction would fall on the common case to serve the rare one.

When an axis is genuinely split, call `AskUserQuestion` — one question per split axis, at most two.
Phrase the options as **readings of their question**, never as skill names:

```text
質問: 「今」はどの範囲を指していますか？
選択肢:
  - 外の世界と比べて — 一般的なやり方として今も妥当か
  - このリポジトリ全体 — コードベース全体が筋の通った状態か
  - この窓の変更 — いま書いた差分がどうか
  - どれでもない — 別の意味だった
```

Include a 「どれでもない」 option. A router that offers only its own three readings will collect one of
them regardless of whether any was right.

## Step 3 — Resolve the destination at runtime

**Do not hardcode a routing table.** Skills are added, renamed, and retired, and a table written into
this file would drift silently — routing to a skill that no longer exists, or missing one that now
owns the answer. Read the installed set instead:

```bash
ls .claude/skills/
head -20 .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md      # frontmatter: name + description + argument-hint
```

Each skill's `description` states what it owns and, at the end, what it explicitly does *not* — that
`Do NOT use it for…` clause is the most reliable routing signal in the frontmatter, because it was
written by whoever owned the boundary. A skill that sits next to another door also carries a
`## Contract` table naming Owns / Never / Starts when / Stops when; read it when the description
leaves the call close.

Pass the resolved reading along with the question, plus the destination's own arguments where the
reading determines one — `repo-truth --depth=full` when the asker needs to know whether something
exists at all, `research --stage=dissolve` when they are asking whether the question is even open,
`how-to --mode=lookup` when they wanted the procedure and not the operation.

If no installed skill owns the question, say so plainly and stop. That is a finding — a gap in the
skill set — not a reason to answer it here.

### The diff reading has one destination, and it is not a skill

**When the world axis resolves to 「この窓の差分」, hand off to the Review Phase Protocol in
`AGENTS.md` — never to one of the review skills directly.**

That protocol names two subjects for a review request (the change and the tests; the comment stock is settled during implementation, not reviewed),
requires an estimate of each skill's return, and asks the user **per skill**. Routing straight to one
of them silently answers a question the protocol exists to put to the user — and it removes the other
two from a flow that went through here, which is exactly the drift the protocol is written against.

So the handoff for this reading is: state that the reading is the diff, and follow the protocol. Read
it at runtime; it is `AGENTS.md`'s, not this skill's, and restating its criteria here would create the
second copy.

## Step 4 — Hand off

State the destination and why, in one line, then invoke it. The user has already approved the reading;
re-confirming the skill choice is a second gate on a decision they just made.

```text
「このリポジトリ全体」の読みで受け取りました。現状の事実は repo-truth が所有します。
```

Handing off is this skill's only output. Do not summarise what the destination will find, do not
pre-answer part of it, and do not run two destinations to compare — the second is not thoroughness, it
is the reading question left unresolved.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--to=<skill>` | The caller already knows the destination; skip Steps 1-3 and hand off |
| `--explain` | Show the axis resolution and the destination, and stop without invoking |

`--explain` is the mode for 「これはどこへ行く問い？」 — a question about the skill set rather than about
the repository. It is also how to inspect a routing decision that felt wrong.

## Not a chain

Routing is the opposite of chaining, and the difference is where the decision sits. A skill that
chains into another decides for the user; this one exists to put that decision in front of them and
then carry it out. That is why the confirmation is not optional when an axis is split, and why the
destination is never invoked twice.

It also means the destinations stay independently invocable. **Nothing here makes `question` the
required entry point** — a clearly-scoped question should go straight to its owner, and this skill is
for the ones that are not.

## Do / Do NOT

- ✅ Phrase options as readings of the question, not as skill names.
- ✅ Always offer 「どれでもない」.
- ✅ Read the installed skills' frontmatter at runtime to resolve the destination.
- ✅ Pass the resolved reading and the destination's arguments along with the question.
- ✅ Say when an open diff or the preceding conversation settled an axis for you.
- ✅ Send the diff reading to the Review Phase Protocol, never to one review skill.
- ✅ Report "no skill owns this" as a finding and stop.
- ✅ Answer in Japanese.
- ❌ Answer the question, build a procedure, compare options, or review anything.
- ❌ Pick a reading when an axis is split.
- ❌ Hardcode a routing table, or route to a skill without confirming it is installed.
- ❌ Read the codebase to disambiguate — the ambiguity is in the asker, not the files.
- ❌ Produce a modal for an unambiguous question.
- ❌ Invoke two destinations to cover both readings.
