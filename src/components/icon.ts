/**
 * アプリが使うアイコンの公開面です。
 *
 * @remarks
 * アイコンの供給元を `components` カーネルの内側へ閉じ込めます（[0052](../../docs/adr/0052-ui-component-policy.md)）。
 * feature も、`components` の各部品も、供給元を直接 import せずここを参照します。差し替えは
 * このファイルの右辺だけで完結し、呼び出し側の綴りは動きません。
 *
 * **名前付き再輸出以外の形にしないでください。** 名前から component を引く表
 * （`{ "chevron-right": ... }`）を置くと、その表がアイコン全 6,000 種への静的な参照になり、
 * 使っていないものまでバンドルへ乗ります。再輸出なら、呼び出し側が import したものだけが残ります。
 *
 * 公開名は供給元の綴りではなく、この面の語彙です。供給元が別の名前で同じ字面を配っていても、
 * ここでの名前は変えません。
